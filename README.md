# :factory: :shower: Automatically refreshing GitHub App tokens

This repo is intended for people looking to understand more about GitHub apps and what an implmentation from a code perspective looks. Where possible the examples look to decorate function calls to the GitHub API. All of the code samples include an example script that share identical output with slight deviances (I'm looking at you Golang). There is no magic, just a simple check to validate the token and making sure our function calls always have a valid token.

I personally learn a lot from example so I wanted to provide some simple notes for me but also to help others get up and running with a GitHub App quickly and with minimal knowledge. What I'm really hoping people take notice of is how similar this code is to using a PAT but also the benefits of not using long lived service accounts and passwords.

#### The Examples :octocat:
- Ruby and Octokit.rb
- Python and PyGitHub
- Go and Go-GitHub
- Javascript and Octokit.js
- C
- Bash (coming soon)
- Java (coming soon, including Jenkins example)

## Background
Many services and vendors including GitHub provide simple authentication methods in particular a personal access token or PAT. This enables users to chain tooling together using a token that belongs to them or through the creation of a service account. While the PAT enables users to interact with services via the API, it widens potential attack surfaces should the PAT become compromised. GitHub App is focusing on removing the need for service accounts and providing a more secure environment that is easier for people and teams to manage.

### Service accounts on GitHub

- Service accounts are real users with interactive login capabilities.
- Users require a seat on GitHub 
- Rotating account passwords can be difficult if mechanisms to facilitate rotation (e.g. Microsoft Key Vault or Hashicorp Vault) do not exist. This includes updating the consumers of the key.
- You must generate a static password and a token for the service account which is really two passwords now.
- It's not uncommon for a service account to get assigned elevated privileges.

## GitHub App

GitHub App enables organizations, repos, and users to provide a standard and secure interface to the API in relation to their GitHub data. GitHub tries to ease some woes mentioned above by enabling access to the API with no service account using the Principle of Least Privilege and couped with short-lived tokens. This document doesn’t cover how to set a GitHub App up, but it’s fairly simple to create. The common question for many is if no user exists, and no static token exists, how do we keep our short-lived tokens fresh? First, we need to to understand how this process works. Once you’ve created and installed a GitHub App you will have in your possession three pieces of required data. A PEM certificate, an `app_id`, and an `installation_id`. Armed with these pieces of data, we can craft a short-lived JWT token and make a secondary request for an access token to the API. The access token we’re provided is also short lived (1 HR).

## Why not OAuth App?

OAuth provides `client_id` and `client_secret` (password) and Octokit/GitHub provide a `.check_token` API attribute. This makes validation very simple, but comes with the cost of an additional HTTP request for validation. GitHub App allows us to circumvent this issue by relying on the `expires_at` key provided by the client response. Ultimately, less API requests are better for everyone. It is worth noting that checking a token using OAuth does not count against the GitHub API rate limit.

## Code example.*

The security and overall cost (seat costs, time spent configuring service accounts) benefits are fairly hard to deny but aren't entirely free either because changes to code are required. In this example I try to minimize the required code needed for a fully automated working example.

In the examples, a single request to the `org_repos` endpoint gets made once every 15 minutes. We let the script run for over an hour to show the behavior.

The example files use a simple `YAML` configuration file which is also included as `.config.yaml` in this repo.

```bash
 ./example.* --sleep 900

```
Initialization recognizes that no token exists on startup and automatically refreshes itself. After an hour and exactly one second after the original token expired, the token gets refreshed automatically and the API can continue to make requests with the proper authentication/token always ensured.

## Simple Auth Class or Function

Using the API enables users to keep tokens fresh with trivial amounts of code.

This example provides two classes unless otherwise noted:

- Authentication for API requests
- Requests to API endpoints wrapped in `auth `

The sizeable difference here between a PAT and GitHub App is fairly simple. A single time check (`expires_at`) determines if the token is still valid and if not, create a fresh instance of the client which gets a new access token. 

## Recap
- Short lived JWT tokens
- Short lived API tokens
- Inexpensive time validation for tokens
- Simple inheritance model for authorization against API endpoints
- Easier to revoke access in the event of a security incident
- No service account required
- No identity (idP) or ADFS/LDAP integration required
- PoLP
